		  <aside class='notes'>
		    <p>Futurism is an <a
		href='http://www.theartstory.org/movement-futurism.htm'>artistic
		    movement that tries to reflect</a> the motifs,
		speed and dynamism of modern life, as well as the
		passage of time. I find it
		appropriate, because it was a way of saying how
		painting was made so far did not make sense in the
		modern world, and also a way of investigating new ways
		of communication that combined different expressions:
		design, painting and typography. Just like cloud
		combines different levels of virtualization, data
		      sources, data processors and data sinks. </p>

		    This work here represent kinda-futurist designs in
		    some dresses. Not incredibly breaking, but at
		    least it's a way of introducing the future into
		    past dress patterns and designs. 
		    You can find works by Liubov Popova, more cubist
		  than futurist, in the <a
		  href='https://www.museothyssen.org/coleccion/artistas/popova-liubov'>Thyssen
		    Bornemisza collection</a>, right here in Madrid, along with other
		  Russian futurist, including Rozanova and male
		    painters of the mainstream Italian futurist
		  branch. In this present, what we have are things
		    looking <em>modern</em>, but that are largely a
		  small change from old, data-center and metal based,
		    methodologies.

		    And the problem is that, for the time being,
		  people just keep doing their old thing in new
		  places. If you had a MEAN or XAMP stack in a shared
		  host or a VPS, you now have it on the cloud. Maybe
		  add monitoring and some other thing on the
		  side. You find containers, and what you do is to put
		  a whole stack inside a container. And this sentence
		  by William Gibson is always true: <blockquote>The
		      future is here, only it's not evenly
		  distributed</blockquote>. I talked to some IT center
		  guys some time ago, couple of months, telling them
		  about the cloud. They said something to the tune of
		  "Yes, we studied it, it's not for us". There is
		  something called "Cloud Center" here. Do you think
		  they use cloud software like OpenStack? Do you know
		  what they do to scale? They get a phone call to do
		  it :-)

		  <h1>Fragmented and divided</h1>

		  <aside class='notes'><blockquote>mientras que la
		  fragmentación espacial y la utilización del collage
		  son muestra de su afán experimental, los colores
		  brillantes provienen de las tradiciones de su tierra
		  natal. Por otra parte, los objetos propios de las
		  naturalezas muertas cubistas, como la botella y la
		  copa, situados en el centro de la composición, se
		  entremezclan con diversos collages de anuncios y
		  fragmentos de artículos recortados de periódicos así
		  como con una gran letra A atravesada por una flecha,
		    situada en el ángulo superior izquierdo.</blockquote>
		    El futurismo started with a technique called <a
		    href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisionism'>divisionism</a>,
		  which divided colors in patches that interacted to
		  create an impression. Also the collage was used as a
		  way to compose the picture. That is the situation
		  right now when you want to develop for the
		  cloud using AI. There are myriad APIs that allow you
		  to tap different computing units at different
		  virtualization levels. Most SDKs and APIs are then
		  fragmented, in such a way that most people use, if
		  anything, a small percentage of the computing
		  services every platform has to offer, not to mention
		  higher-level services. It's also fragmented along
		  vendor lines. You can either develop for lambda or
		  for functions or for OpenWhisk. The situation is
		  similar in the GPU arena, where they don't even have
		  the same names for the same things. Unfortunately,
		  this is also reflected in the TAGs themselves:
		  Containers here, cloud SDKs there, but they are
		  basically working with the same stuff and tapping
		  the same resources. One of the consequences of
		    this is the <em>devout</em> nature of most tools,
		by devout meaning non-agnostic. You can work with a
		single vendor, and that happens at any level of the
		    cloud stack. And agnosticism is good from the
		  point of view of the ROI, it's not worth the while
		  to be religious if you know that you are going to
		  have to divest in 4 or 5 years. Desktop computing
		  take off when there was a single platform, the
		  PC+MSDos, and later Windows and Linux, which you
		  could target your applications for. Before, you
		  could commit yourself to an Olivetti, or Burroughs,
		  or whatever platform, but what was the point? It
		  could be gone in a few years. When the religious
		  division of the early 80s gave way to the
		  agnosticism of the PC, it was the end of the IBMs
		  and EDS and the emergence of Microsoft and Lotus and
		    those <em>agnostic</em> companies that could write
		  to a whole set of computers, all of them with a
		  common abstraction layer over them. Their investment
		  was returned.
		    Most <em>agnostic</em> tools fall
		  very short of covering the full range of
		  functionalities, and it even fails in basic stuff
		  like IAM authentication or specification of
		  containers. There are some steps in this particular
		  direction like the <a
		  href='https://www.opencontainers.org/'>Open
		    Container Initiative</a> but that's it. Terraform also is
		  agnostic, but it still lacks the functionality to
		  work with all the possible functionalities.

		  academia does not give a shit about this new
		  environment, it's that even if it did, I'm not sure
		  we're ready for the onslaught of new concepts, APIs,
		  and methodologies. New stuff is created yearly and
		  you need 10 years to change courses, at least in
		  Spain. There are new recommendations with even a

		<aside class='notes'>Closed source, in general, is
		bad in this or any context. It keeps innovation within
		the companies, and does not allow an environment of
		coopetition which will push the whole technology
		forward. Non-standard APIs are also a problem, even
		more so than a closed API. And it happens across the
		table, everywhere. Data stores, message queues,
		security parameters, they are private and thus there
		is no way to test or install in-house, debug, and all
		the problems that closed source brings. There is also
		a big gap between what is offered by OpenStack or
		other open source players and what you get for big
		players. That is a problem for academia, and increases
		  the gap above. </aside>

		  <aside class='notes'>There are many initiatives that
		attempt to give a holistic, unified view of the cloud,
		which is, after all, where we nowadays run our
		computer. But it's still in its infancy, akin to when
		you were programming in the 80s and 90s and needed to
		work with interrupts and port addresses when you
		wanted to work with sound or, for that matter, with a
		printer or anything that did not come with the
		computer. First operating systems and compilers made
		with that: they used heuristics and engineering to
		create code that was the best for every combination of
		hardware, using FPU when available, and so on. You
		could recompile for a slightly different
		configuration, but that's it. Today you don't need to
		fire a different program with an ARM Cortex or an
		Intel i7: the fragmented reality of the underlying
		hardware is embedded, as knowledge, in the operating
		    system and toolchains. We have <a
		    href='http://isomorphic.net/'>Isomorphic
		javascript</a>, for instance. We also have serverless
		libraries that work with any framework. Terraform is
		able to work with many different providers, and
		kubernetes works acrosss organizations. But even if we
		have patterns, we still lack a common way of creating
		buildings, from scratch. Draft, which was released by
		Microsoft 
		yesterday, is an amazing piece of work. It allows
		someone to work easily with kubernetes, just by
		defining something like a "buildpack", which is a way
		to insert different tool and languages inside
		containers and connect them. This is interesting from
		the point of view of abstraction. As we fly into the
		future, we find ways of adding layers of abstraction
		to our tools that bridge that gap, that chasm that
		exists between what we have learned and the tools we
		have to use.

		  <p class='fija'>Natalia Goncharova, Cyclist from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Goncharova#/media/File:Cyclist_(Goncharova,_1913).jpg'>Wikipedia</a></p>
		  <aside class='notes'> This is what it's said about
		  "The Cyclist" in <a
		    href='http://www.theartstory.org/movement-russian-futurism-artworks.htm#pnt_4'>its
		    description</a>:
		    <blockquote> Despite its renowned importance in
		    the history of Russian art, this scene by
		    Goncharova is something of an anomaly among
		    Russian Futurist paintings given its depiction of
		    the action of motion - an approach usually only
		    found in Italian Futurist works. This work layers
		    the Western focus on motion with a distinctively
		    Russian focus on language. Fragments of words have
		    been captured on the canvas indicating the window
		    advertisements of the shops the cyclist passes -
		    silk, thread, hats, and more. However, the cyclist
		    seems to ignore these expensive wares as he pedals
		    doggedly on; he is even directed back from whence
		    he came by a large hand pointing behind him. His
		    difficult journey on cobbled streets reverberates
		    through his body, and the painting becomes a
		    commentary on the state of the working condition
		    rather than a celebration of modern
		    locomotion. While the political aspects of the
		    painting are similar to some of Goncharova's
		    earlier works, its frame-by-frame depiction of
		    movement sets it apart. It exists in-between;
		    neither Italian Futurism nor strictly Russian, it
		    seems to capture the conflict between the two
		      movements.</blockquote>
		    The nice and amazing thing about this picture, for
		    me the best in the Futurist movement, since it
		    bridges the Italian and Russian brand of it, is
		    that it shows the discovery of a new pictorial
		    language that is able to capture the motion, the
		    speed, the information overload of the
		    city. In the computer realm, languages and
		    operating systems are needed to abstract the
		    underlying functionalities, allowing us to create
		    applications easily, but also to understand the
		    system as a whole, and not as a sum of parts.
		    That operating system, or the compilers working
		    with it, will have
		  to include machine learning and artificial
		  intelligence to self-reconfigure for the best and
		  cheapest combination of cloud services available on
		  call, be it hybrid, public or private. Nowadays you
		  don't care where the rendering of a textured,
		  multifaceted polygon is taking place, because it's
		    the compiler that takes care of generating the
		    correct code. Why should you
		  care about your function running in a container, a
		    PaaS, or using ready-made software as a service?
		  The <a
		  href='http://www.theartstory.org/movement-russian-futurism.htm'>Russian
		    futurism <em> proposing a new visual and
		  linguistic vocabulary for modern
		  experience.</em>. This FuturOS together with a cloud
		  toolchain and a language that reflects the
		  underlying system will be, of course, free software,
		  but will allow us, like this painting that is, for
		  me, the summit of futurism, to use it to full
		  capabilities. Also bridge the gap with academia. At
		    least a little bit.</a>
